How we judge success

* Usefullness
Our mission is to help people select the most unique gifts to their family and friends more efficiently and the main purpose of this application is to solve the problem for users - to provide a single source from the souvenir selection and product/ store information. Thus, we consider this quality the most important. 

* User Efficiency
User Efficiency stands the speed with which a user can find the most satisfying shop in our web application. Our success depends much on whether or not users can get the best results in our website. 

* Maintainability
Since our software is only restricted in Greater Seattle area. When it comes to other regions, it needs to be updated and maintained by software engineers in the future. Also, if there are new stores appeared, their information are required to be added in our database.

* Consistency
We want our users to have a better browsing experience. We’ll pay attention to the layouts and the wording to make sure everything on the website is consistent with each other. It’s not only because we don’t want our users confused by inconsistent expressions but also we believe it’s a critical part of design requirement.
