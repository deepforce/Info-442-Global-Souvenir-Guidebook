## Problem Statement:
With the development of city touring, traveling has become part of people’s daily life. They travel all over the world to see and experience. Besides, there are always needs for gifts and souvenirs to bring to their beloved ones, trying to let them feel the wonderful experience and culture on the road as well. From city t-shirts to local cuisine, it seems that there are lots of choices absolutely perfect as gifts. However, it’s really hard for tourists or even new coming residents to find those good gifts and souvenirs. They have no idea what the local specials are and where to get them. Most travellers just buy something randomly without ensured qualities when visiting tourist spots. As a result, selecting and buying souvenirs do become a problem for those travellers.
